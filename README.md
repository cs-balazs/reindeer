# Reindeer

A study renderer written in rust that supports opengl 4 and webgl 2 with wasm. In the future it will hopefully support vulkan and webgpu as well.

A demo is available at [https://cs-balazs.github.io/reindeer](https://cs-balazs.github.io/reindeer)

## Build

For opengl, the `opengl` feature has to be set.

For webgl, there are helper scripts in the `scripts` folder.
